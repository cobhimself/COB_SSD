COB Sequence Selection Destoryer
================================

1.0.0

 - Initial release.

1.0.1

 - Because of possible changes to the scripting API in CS5.5, the script does
 not automatically add the start and end frames when selecting a RQ Item if the
 user is using CS5.5. This will be fixed in a future release.

 1.1.0

 - The script now automatically adds the start and end frames when selecting a
 RQ Item, even if the user is using CS5.5.
