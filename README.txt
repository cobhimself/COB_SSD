COB_ISSD V. 1
=============

The point of COB_ISSD (Image Sequence Section Deleter) is to allow the user to
easily and quickly delete portions (or all) of a selected image sequence
directly from within After Effects.

Why would I use it?
===================

We all know that, even though it takes an extra step to render an image
sequence before rendering to a movie file, rendering to an image sequence is
much safer. If an image sequence render blows up, all is not lost! Once you
figure out what caused the render error, all you have to do is restart your
render and rendering will begin from where it left off.

Rendering to an image sequence does have its drawbacks though. If you modify
something within your project, you must delete the previously rendered frames
so they will be re-rendered 
so only the non-existing frames are re-rendered.

It is most useful when having to delete only a section of an
image sequence for re-render.
